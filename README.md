## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

## Working

This is a memory game. It consists of 16 pairs of cards where each pair has identical shapes on its hidden side.

You have to match each shape with its pair.

You win when you match all the pairs.

Each two cards you unravel, will be considered as a move. Do it in as less moves as possible.
